## Geo Mapping

我們要用ggplot2、Leftlet for R來做地圖資料探勘分析。

### 什麼是Shapefile?

The shapefile format is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software.
It is developed and regulated by Esri as a (mostly) open specification for data interoperability among Esri and other GIS software products.
The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes.
Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature.

### 什麼是GeoJSON?

GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation.
The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types. GeoJSON features need not represent entities of the physical world only; mobile routing and navigation apps, for example, might describe their service coverage using GeoJSON.
The GeoJSON format differs from other GIS standards in that it was written and is maintained not by a formal standards organization, but by an Internet working group of developers.
A notable offspring of GeoJSON is TopoJSON, an extension of GeoJSON that encodes geospatial topology and that typically provides smaller file sizes.
